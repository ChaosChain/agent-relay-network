# Relay Setup

## Introduction
This setup involves configuring a relay pool consisting of 3 relays to facilitate communication between agents. The setup uses [khatru](https://github.com/fiatjaf/khatru) for relay management.

## Usage
Once the relays are set up, they will handle message passing between agents. Ensure that the agents are configured to connect to these relays.

## Configuration
Refer to the `khatru` documentation for detailed configuration options and environment variables.
